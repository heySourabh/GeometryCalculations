# GeometryCalculations
Calculation of geometry properties for various shapes for use in algorithms

In numerical computations very often we need to calculate properties of shapes such as area, volume, lengths, centroids etc. So, very often I find myself looking up these formulas again and again. Therefore, I decided to put together the relations here along with possible algorithms.
