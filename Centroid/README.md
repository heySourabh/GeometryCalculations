The centroid, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Br%7D), of a solid is defined as,

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Br%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BVolume%7D%5Ciiint%5Climits_%7BV%7Dr%5C%20dV)

where, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r) is a position vector. The centroid has a few very interesting properties such as:
1. For a homogeneous solid it is the _center of mass_
2. The centroid can be translated / rotated to any co-ordinate system by simple linear transformation
3. For any _linear function_, the average of the function inside the solid can be calculated by simply evaluating the function at the centroid point.
